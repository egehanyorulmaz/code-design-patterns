# Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern simplifies the process of constructing complex objects by allowing incremental creation. It's a powerful tool in object-oriented programming that emphasizes clarity and control. Below, you'll find an explanation of how this pattern works, its advantages and disadvantages, and its relevance in various scenarios.

## Introduction

The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern used to separate the creation of an object from its representation. It is particularly useful when dealing with complex objects that require multiple steps for construction, allowing the creation of the object incrementally rather than all at once.

## How It Works

The Builder pattern involves a builder class responsible for the construction process of the object. This class provides methods for setting each of the object's attributes and returns the fully constructed object once all attributes have been set.

## Benefits

Using the Builder pattern offers several advantages:

1. **Simplified Complex Object Creation:** The pattern enables the creation of complex objects without the need for an excessive number of constructor arguments.
2. **Support for Optional Attributes:** Objects with optional attributes can be easily handled. Omitting the corresponding setter method avoids setting that specific attribute.
3. **Flexibility and Maintainability:** The pattern enhances the flexibility and maintainability of the codebase, making it easier to adapt to changes in the object's structure.

## Disadvantages Compared to Other Patterns

However, it's essential to be aware of its limitations:

1. **Increased Complexity:** Introduces an additional layer, which might not be needed for simpler objects.
2. **Overhead:** May introduce additional overhead due to the creation of builder objects and multiple method calls.
3. **Limited Reusability:** Might not be suitable for simple objects or scenarios where object creation is straightforward.

## Usage Example

You can use the Builder pattern in the included in the examples below.

## Applicability

Consider using the Builder pattern when:
- You want to construct a complex object step by step.
- The object must be constructed with various configurations.
- The construction process must allow different representations of the constructed object.

## Related Patterns

- **Factory Pattern**: Provides an interface for creating objects, promoting loose coupling.
- **Prototype Pattern**: Creates new objects by copying existing instances.
