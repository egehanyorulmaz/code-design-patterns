# Factory Pattern

The Factory pattern is a creational design pattern used to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. It defines an interface for creating objects, allowing the subclass to decide which class to instantiate. Below, you'll find an explanation of how this pattern works, its advantages and disadvantages, and its relevance in various scenarios.

## Introduction

The Factory pattern provides an interface for creating instances of a class, with its subclasses deciding which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses, providing a way to delegate the instantiation logic to another object.

## How It Works

The Factory pattern involves a factory class responsible for the object creation process. This class includes a method that returns a new instance of the object, allowing subclasses to override the method to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Benefits

Using the Factory pattern offers several advantages:

1. **Encapsulation of Creation Logic:** Hides the creation logic from the client code, making the code more robust, flexible, and maintainable.
2. **Promotes Loose Coupling:** Reduces the dependency of the client code on the concrete classes, promoting loose coupling between the client and the classes being instantiated.
3. **Flexibility in Object Creation:** Allows easy addition or alteration of the classes that are instantiated without affecting existing code.

## Disadvantages Compared to Other Patterns

However, it's essential to be aware of its limitations:

1. **Increased Complexity:** Introduces additional classes and interfaces, which might add complexity to the codebase.
2. **Code Maintenance:** If not designed carefully, adding new classes might require changes to the factory method, impacting maintainability.

## Usage Example

You can use the Factory pattern in the included in the examples below.

## Applicability

Consider using the Factory pattern when:
- You need to ensure that the created objects can follow specific constraints or rules.
- The client code should be independent of the system's classes and their creation logic.
- The system needs to be configured with one of multiple families of related classes.
