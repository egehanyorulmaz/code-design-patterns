# Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern used to define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. Below, you'll find an explanation of how this pattern works, its advantages and disadvantages, and its relevance in various scenarios.

## Introduction

The Observer pattern provides a way to communicate changes to an object's state to all registered observers. It allows objects known as observers to watch a subject for state changes, promoting a decoupling between the subject and its observers.

## How It Works

The Observer pattern involves two types of objects: Subjects and Observers. Subjects are watched by Observers. When a subject's state changes, it notifies all its registered observers.

## Benefits

Using the Observer pattern offers several advantages:

1. **Promotes Loose Coupling:** Decouples the subject from its observers, allowing them to interact without being tightly linked.
2. **Enhanced Communication:** Enables an object to notify other objects of state changes without knowing who or what those objects are.
3. **Dynamic Relationships:** Allows for adding, removing, or modifying observers at runtime without modifying the subject.

## Disadvantages Compared to Other Patterns

However, it's essential to be aware of its limitations:

1. **Unexpected Updates:** If not managed carefully, can lead to unexpected updates, causing issues in system stability.
2. **Memory Leaks:** If observers are not properly unregistered, it might lead to memory leaks.

## Usage Example

You can use the Observer pattern in systems where a change in one object must be communicated to others without knowing exactly who those objects are, such as event handling systems, or updating user interfaces.

## Applicability

Consider using the Observer pattern when:
- You want to build a subscription mechanism where subscribers are notified of events or state changes.
- Multiple objects are dependent on the state of a single object, and they need to be updated automatically.
