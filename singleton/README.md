# Singleton Pattern

The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Below, you'll find an explanation of how this pattern works, its advantages and disadvantages, and its relevance in various scenarios.

## Introduction

The Singleton pattern involves a single instance class which provides a global point of access to that instance. The class is responsible for creating and managing the instance of itself and ensures that there is only one instance of the class that is created throughout the application.

## How It Works

The Singleton pattern involves a single class responsible for the object creation process. This class includes methods and variables that ensure there's only one instance of itself throughout the application.

## Benefits

Using the Singleton pattern offers several advantages:

1. **Provides a Single Point of Access:** To the instance of the class.
2. **Guarantees One Instance:** There is only one instance of the class throughout the application.
3. **Improves Performance:** By avoiding unnecessary instantiation of the class.
4. **Simplifies Code:** By reducing the number of global variables required.

## Disadvantages Compared to Other Patterns

However, it's essential to be aware of its limitations:

1. **Complicates Testing:** Due to the use of global state.
2. **Code Difficulty:** Can make the code more difficult to understand due to the use of static methods and variables.
3. **Tight Coupling:** Can result in tight coupling between the Singleton class and other classes that depend on it.

## Usage Example

Overall, the Singleton pattern is a useful design pattern for ensuring that there is only one instance of a class throughout the application and providing a global point of access to that instance. However, it should be used judiciously to avoid the potential disadvantages of global state and tight coupling.

## Applicability

Consider using the Singleton pattern when:
- You want to ensure that a class has only one instance.
- You want to provide a global point of access to the object.
