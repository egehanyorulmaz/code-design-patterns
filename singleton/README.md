# Singleton Pattern

The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. Below, you'll find an explanation of how this pattern works, its advantages and disadvantages, and its relevance in various scenarios.

## How It Works

The Singleton pattern involves a single class responsible for the object creation process. This class includes methods and variables that ensure there's only one instance of itself throughout the application.

## Benefits

Using the Singleton pattern offers several advantages:

1. **Provides a Single Point of Access:** To the instance of the class.
2. **Guarantees One Instance:** There is only one instance of the class throughout the application.
3. **Improves Performance:** By avoiding unnecessary instantiation of the class.
4. **Simplifies Code:** By reducing the number of global variables required.

## Disadvantages Compared to Other Patterns

However, it's essential to be aware of its limitations:

1. **Complicates Testing:** Due to the use of global state.
2. **Code Difficulty:** Can make the code more difficult to understand due to the use of static methods and variables.
3. **Tight Coupling:** Can result in tight coupling between the Singleton class and other classes that depend on it.

## Usage Example

Overall, the Singleton pattern is a useful design pattern for ensuring that there is only one instance of a class throughout the application and providing a global point of access to that instance. However, it should be used judiciously to avoid the potential disadvantages of global state and tight coupling.

## Applicability

Consider using the Singleton pattern when:
- You want to ensure that a class has only one instance.
- You want to provide a global point of access to the object.
